# rofi-libvirt

Simple custom script for [Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) to manage libvirt domains.

## Requirements

You need libvirt python binding : `python3-libvirt` on Debian, `libvirt-python` on Archlinux.

## Configuration

You can change variable `url` in the script to fit your need, for instance if you wish to connect to a remote libvirt instance.
